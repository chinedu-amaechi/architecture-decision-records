- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-11-04
- **Deciders**: Chinedu Amaechi, Nikita Sharma, Faruq Ogukunle
- **Tags**: UI Design, React Native Paper, Material Design

## Context
The app requires a user-friendly, visually cohesive interface across devices. A polished, intuitive UI enhances user satisfaction and brand perception, which is critical for a retail-focused app.

## Decision
We selected **React Native Paper** as the primary UI library in conjunction with React Native. React Native Paper provides Material Design components optimized for mobile use and cross-platform consistency.

## Rationale
- **Consistency and Efficiency**: React Native Paper’s pre-built components speed up UI development, ensuring a professional look that aligns with Material Design standards.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: React Native Paper’s components automatically adjust for both iOS and Android, maintaining a unified appearance.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Speeds up development, providing a polished, cohesive interface across devices and screen sizes.
- **Negative**: Limited customization in some cases. Custom components may be necessary for unique branding requirements.
